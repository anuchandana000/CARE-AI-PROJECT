# CARE-AI 🩺🤖  
**AI-Powered Disease Prediction for Remote Healthcare**

---

## 🌍 Problem Statement  
In remote and underserved areas, access to timely medical diagnosis is limited due to lack of healthcare professionals and infrastructure. This often leads to **delayed detection of critical diseases** such as heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, and maternal health complications.  

---

## 💡 Our Solution  
**CARE-AI** leverages **machine learning** to predict the likelihood of multiple diseases using patient history.  
- Provides a **lightweight, accessible, and user-friendly web application**.  
- Empowers healthcare workers and patients in rural/remote areas.  
- Supports **early detection and preventive care**.  

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- 📊 Multi-disease prediction (Heart Disease, Diabetes, Alzheimer’s, Maternal Health).  
- 🌐 Web-based interface for easy access.  
- ⚡ Lightweight and deployable on low-resource systems.  
- 🔒 Secure handling of patient data.
